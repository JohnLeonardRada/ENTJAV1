 * <p/>However, sometimes you may wish to override this message on a per-field basis. You can do this by adding an i18n
 * key associated with just your action (Action.properties) using the pattern <b>invalid.fieldvalue.xxx</b>, where xxx
 * is the field name.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>It is important to know that none of these errors are actually reported directly. Rather, they are added to a map
 * called <i>conversionErrors</i> in the ActionContext. There are several ways this map can then be accessed and the
 * errors can be reported accordingly.
